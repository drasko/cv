   \textit{Work on platform enablement, system and device drivers for LTE
   multi-processor SoCs, based on ARM946E-S, MIPS24Kc and Lattice Mico32
   architectures with eCos RTOS (for baseband CPU) and Linux (for application CPU)
   as a systems of choice.}

\begin{itemize}
   \item Board bring-up and HW/SW debugging (JTAG, oscilloscope,
         logic analyzer, HW modifications)
   \item Fully developed (from scratch) USIM physical layer driver and
            transport protocol layers of T=0 and T=1 protocols for Smart Card
            communication. Used Comprion and Micropross SC sniffers/analyzers
            and debugged solution. Debugged ASIC bugs and created workarounds
            in SW. Debugged HW bugs due to the rising edge timings and voltage
            levels using oscillosope and logic analyzers. 
            Designed (specification) and implemented low-level API and 
            created a suite of unitary and productions tests.
   \item Enabled OpenOCD open-source project for ARM946E-S and MIPS24Kc
            platforms, contributing patches to the community under GPL
            licence by merging separatly maintained git repositories to the
            project mainline. Wrote complex shell and TCL scripts for usage of cheap
            FTDI-based USB JTAG dongles and replacing expensive trhird-partner solutions,
            which significantly reduced development expenses for the company.
            Given a support and training to other engineers on using
            implemented solution. 
   \item Revese-engineered Lattice Mico32 MonitorROM and third-party VHDL code
            in order to develop support for OpenOCD usage of Layer 1 debugging by
            JTAG. Adapted UrJTAG for very low-level JTAG communication debugging.
   \item Fully ported uClinux to SQN3110 SoC application processor based on
            ARM946E-S.
   \item Fullty ported Linux for MIPS, OpenWRT distribution to SQN3110 FPGA
            chip, and re-wrote specific configuration, Makefile, shell and Perl scripts
            and prepared a series of patches in a build system.
   \item Fully wrote (from the scratch) scatter-gather zero-copy solution for
            inter-processor communication based on parallel communication between eCos
            and uClinux network drivers, using SW circular FIFOs and HW pointers.
            Developed Linux application to test the implementation by receiving
            RF packets sent from the eNodeB, sent via eCos driver and received
            on Linux side, and observed traffic using Wireshark.
   \item Ported SDIO Linux device drivers for SQN3110 FPGA-based SoC. Created
            workarounds (driver quirks) for ASIC bugs
            (misunderstood SDIO specification) of a third-party SDIO controller IP.
   \item Implemented series of eCos RTOS drivers (watchdog, nework activity
            GPIO, flash handling...) and low-level services. Modified
            bootloader code and NVRAM configuration in the binary form.
   \item Implemented IQ Missmatch driver for calculation phase, gain and offset
            convergence and correction, and tested solution using tone generator and
            tweaking Maxim RF chip set-up. implemented AT commands and services for
            controlling of the solution.
   \item Implemented driver for reading ISO images stored on the NOR flash and
            proper handling of sector handling and wear leveling. Implemented
            unitary test eCos application by creating ISO images on host Linux
            and turning USB dongles (dev boards) into ISO storage.
   \item Compiled and prepared toolchains for ARMEB, MIPSEB and LM32
            architectures based on Binutils v2.19, GCC v4.5.1 and GDB v7.3.
            Tested and debugged solutions on all 3 architectures and integrated
            it into development build process.
