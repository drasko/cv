   \textit{Work on platform enablement, system and device drivers for LTE
   multi-processor SoCs, based on ARM946E-S, MIPS24Kc and Lattice Mico32
   architectures with eCos RTOS (for baseband CPU) and Linux (for application CPU)
   as a systems of choice.}

         designs from FPGA simulations and prototypes, through PCBs with first ASIC versions up
         to the mature chip product

            architectures based on Binutils, GCC and GDB.
            Tested and debugged solutions on all 3 architectures and integrated
            it into development build process.
   \item Fully ported uClinux to SQN3010 SoC application processor based on
            ARM946E-S. Fully ported Linux for MIPS, OpenWRT distribution to SQN3110 FPGA
            chip, and re-wrote specific configuration, Makefile, shell and Perl scripts
            and prepared a series of patches in a build system.
   \item Implemented series of Linux device drivers (GPIO, SDIO, ...) and
            low-level and userspace services. Created SW workarounds (driver
            quirks) for ASIC bugs (specification non-alignments) in third party
            IP cores
   \item Fully developed (from scratch) USIM physical layer driver and
            transport protocol layers of T=0 and T=1 protocols for Smart Card
            communication. Used Comprion and Micropross SC sniffers/analyzers
            and debugged solution. Debugged ASIC bugs and created workarounds
            in SW. Debugged HW bugs using oscilloscope and logic analyzers. 
            Designed (specification) and implemented low-level API and 
            created a suite of unitary and productions tests

            platforms, contributing patches to the community under GPL
            licence. Reverse-engineered Lattice Mico32 MonitorROM and third-party VHDL code.
            Adapted UrJTAG for very low-level JTAG communication debugging.
            Wrote complex shell and TCL scripts for usage of cheap
            FTDI-based USB JTAG dongles and replacing expensive third-partner solutions,

            inter-processor communication based on parallel communication between eCos
            and uClinux network drivers, using SW circular FIFOs and HW pointers.
            Developed Linux application to test the implementation by receiving
            RF packets sent from the eNodeB, sent via eCos driver and received
            on Linux side, and observed traffic using Wireshark
   \item Implemented series of eCos RTOS drivers (watchdog, nework activity
            GPIO, flash handling...) and low-level services :
